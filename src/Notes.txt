/**********React Notes**********/

// React JS:
--> React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source JS library for building user interfaces based on components. Was created by Facebook and is now maintained by Meta(formery Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies.

// Component-based:
--> React applications are build using reusable components, which are like building blocks for our UI. Each component encapsulates its own logic and rendering, making it easier to manage and maintain complex UIs.

// Declarative:
--> In React, we describe how our UI should look based on different states of our application. React takes care of updating the UI efficiently when the underlying data changes.

// Virtual DOM:
--> React uses a virtual representation of the real DOM(Document Object Model) to optimize performance. It minimizes direct manipulation of the actual DOM, which can be slow. 

// JSX:
--> React uses a syntax extension called JSX(JavaScript XML) that allows us to write HTML like code within our JS. This makes it easier to create and visualize UI components.

// Unidirectional data flow:
Data in React typically flows in one direction, from parent components to child components. This helps in understanding how data changes propagate through our application. 

// React is widely used to build:
--> Single-page application(SPAs): Web applications that load a single HTML page and dynamically update content as the user interacts with the app.
--> Mobile applications(using React Native): Reaact Native allows us to build cross-platform mobile apps using the same principles and components as React for the web.
--> Server-rendered applications(using frameworks like Next.js): React can be rendered on the server-side for improved performance and SEO.

// Is React right for us?
--> react has a large community and ecosystem, which means there are plenty of resources available to help us learn and use it effectively. It is a popular choice for building modern, interactive web applications and mobile apps. However, it has a learning curve, especially for developers new to concepts like component-based architecture and virtual DOM.

// HTLM Fragment:
--> An HTML fragment is a piece of HTML code that contains common elements or features that can be reused. For example, we can create HTML fragments for a navigation menu, footer, contact form, or banner.

--> HTML fragments can help reduce errors, improve performance, and make code easier to update by avoiding the need to repeat the same code multiple times. They can also be used to store frequently needed HTML text, JS, or Css text.

--> In React, an HTML fragment is a way to group multile elements together without adding an extra node to the DOM. It's like a virtual container that holds our elements, allowing us to return multiple elements from a component's render method without wrapping them in a needless div or other container.

// Benefits of using fragments:
1. Avoids unnecessary DOM notes:
--> Fragments don't render any additonal elements in the DOM, which can improve performance and reduce the complexity of our HTML structure.

2. Cleaner code:
--> Fragments help us organize and group elements logically without introducing extra divs, making our code more readable and maintainable.

3. Flexibility:
--> We can use fragments to return multiple elements from a component, making it easier to create reusable components.

// When to use fragments:
1. Returning multiple elements from a component:
--> Use fragments when we need to return multiple elements without adding extra DOM nodes.

2. Creating reusable components:
--> Fragments can help us group related elements together, making it easier to create reusable components that can be used in different parts of our applications.

3. Improving code readability:
--> Fragments can make our code more readable by avoiding unnecessary wrapping elements.

// JSX fragment:
--> Fragments allow the return of multiple JSX elements, which addresses the issue of invalid HTML markups within react application that were caused by the must-have constraint of only one element returning per component.


/*******************************************/

** In react, "props" and "propTypes" are important concepts for building reusable components and ensuring data integrity.

// Props (short for properties):
-> Purpose: Props are used to pass data from a parent component ot its child components. This allows us to create reusable components that can be customized with different data.

-> How to use: Props are passed as attributes when we render a component. 

// PropTypes:
-> Purpose: Proptypes are used to validate the data types of props passed to a component. This helps us catch errors early on and ensure that our components are receiving the right kind of data.

-> How to use: We can define propTypes for our components using the prop-types library. 

// Default Props:
-> In react, defaultProps is a property of a component that allows us to set default values for its props. This is useful for providing fallback values when a parent component doesn't pass a specific prop.

// .isRequired property:
-> In react, .isRequired is a modifier used with PropTypes to specify that a particular prop is mandatory for a component to function correctly. If a component is rendered without the required prop, React will display a warning in the console during development.

** Benefits: 
1. Helps us catch potential bugs during development.
2. Provides documentatoin for the expected types of props.
3. Makes our code more robust and maintainable.

// Export Default And Named Export
--> In React, "export default" and "named export" are mechanisms to make components, functions, or variables available for use in other parts of our application. They are part of the JS module system, which allow us to break down our code into reusable module.

// Export Default:
1. We can only have one default export per file.
2. It is imported without curly braces.
3. We can assign any name to the default export during import.

// Named Export:
1. We can have multiple named exports per file.
2. They are imported using curly braces and must be imported with the same name they were exported with.

// Key Differences:
1. Number of exports:
-> Default export allows only one per file, while named export allows multiple.

2. Import Syntax:
-> Default exports are imported without curly braces, while named exports require them.

3. Naming flexibility:
-> We can choose any name when iporting a default export, while named exports must be imported with their original names.

// When to use Which:
1. Default export:
-> Use it when we want to export the primary component or function from a module.

2. Named exports:
-> Use it when we want to export multiple values from a module, giving the user the option to import only what they need.

...................................

// Import Default and Named Imports:
-> In react, import default and named imports are used to bring in components, functions, or variables from other modules(files). 

// Default Import:
1. A module can have only one default export.
2. When importing a default export, we can choose any name for it.
3. Syntax: import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

// Named Import:
1. A module can have multiple named exports.
2. When importing named exports, we must use the exact same names as defined in the exporting module.
3. We can iimport specific named exports or all of them.
4. Syntax:
    * Import specific named exports: import {Component A, Component B} from './MyComponent';

    * Import all named exports: import * as MyComponent from './MyComponent';


********************************************

// Hooks In React:
-> React Hooks are functions that allow us to "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components. Introduced in React 16.8, they provide a way to use state and other React features without writing a class component.

// Most commonly used hooks:
1. useState: Lets we add state to functional components.
2. useEffect: Lets we perform side effects in functional components, such as fetching data, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM.
3. useContext: Lets we access the value of a React Context from within a functional Component.

// Benefits of using React Hooks:
1. Cleaner code: Hooks allow us to write more concise and readable code compared to class components.
2. Better code reuse: Hooks allow us to extract and reuse stateful logic between components.
3. Improved performance: Hooks can help optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders.


// State Variables:
--> In React, a state variable is a special type of variable that allows components to store and anage data that changes over time. When a state variable is updated, React automatically re-renders the component to reflect the new value.

1. Declaring a State Variable:
-> State variables are declared using the useState hook in functional components.
-> useState takes an initial value as an argument and returns an array with two elements.
    * The first element is the current value of the state variable
    * The second element is a function used to update the state variable.

2. Updating a State Variable:
-> To update a state variable, call the setter fnction returned by useState. 

3. State as a Snapshot:
-> React state is treated as a snapshot. When we update state, React doesn't directly modify the existing state variable. Instead, it creates a new version the state and triggers a re-render of the component.

**************************************************

// React Router:
--> React Router is a popular JS library used for routing in React application. It enables us to create single-page application(SPAs) with multiple views and seamless navigation between them, all while maintaining the UI in sync with the URL.

// Key Features of React Router:
1. Declarative Routing:
-> Define router using components-like syntax, making it easy to understand and maintain our application's navigation structure.

2. Client-side Routing:
-> React Router handles routing on the client-side, meaning page transitions happen without full page reloads, providing a smooth user experience.

3. Dynamic Routing:
-> Create routes with dynamic segments that can match different URL patterns, allowing us to build flexible and interactive applications.

4. Nested Routes:
-> Organize our routes hierarchically, making it easier to manage complex applications with multiple sections or sub-sections.

5. BrowserRouter and HashRouter:
-> Choose between different router types depending on our hosting environment and URL preferences.

6. Link Component:
-> Use the Link component to create links that trigger router changes without causing full page refreshes.

7. Route Component:
-> Define which component to render based on the current URL path.

// Commonly Used Components in React Router.
1. BrowserRouter: The most common router type, uses the browser's history API to manage URLs.

2. Routes: A container for defining multiple Route components.

3. Route: Matches a specific URL path and renders the corresponding component.

4. Link: Creates a clicable link that navigates to a specific route.

5. NavLink: A special type of link that adds active styling when the current URL matches the link's route.

6. Outlet: Renders the child routes of a parent route, enabling nested routing.
